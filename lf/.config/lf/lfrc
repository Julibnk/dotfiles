# Enhancing the rename command
# lf by default places the cursor right before the extension when renaming a file.
# However you can add additional bindings for other renaming schemes with the following config:
map r # unmap the default rename keybinding
map i rename # rename with the cursor placed at the extension (original behavior)	rename: foo|.txt
map I :rename; cmd-home # rename with the cursor placed at the beginning	        rename: |foo.txt
map A :rename; cmd-end # rename with the cursor placed at the end	                rename: foo.txt|
map r :rename; cmd-delete-home # rename with the portion before the extension deleted	rename: |.txt
map R :rename; cmd-end; cmd-delete-home # rename with the entire filename deleted	rename: |

# navigate to common directories
map md cd ~/Documents/ 
map mD cd ~/Downloads/
# map mc cd ~/.config/
# map mz cd ~/.config/zsh/ 
# map mn cd ~/.config/nvim/
map mw cd ~/dev/work
map mg cd ~/dev/github

# eza can be used to provide the file information shown in the bottom left corner:
cmd on-select &{{
    lf -remote "send $id set statfmt \"$(eza -ld --color=always "$f" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g;s/"/\\"/g')\""
